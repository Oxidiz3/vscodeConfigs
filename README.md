# vscodeConfigs


Go to C:\Users\\{User\}\AppData\Roaming\Code\User and initialize the repo by doing

- `git init .`
- `git remote add origin https://github.com/Oxidiz3/vscodeConfigs`
- `git fetch origin`
- `git checkout main`

Anytime there is an update that you want to pull or push you need to create a branch

- `git checkout -b mm_dd_yyyy`

then push 
- `git push -u origin mm_dd_yyyy`

then you'll need to solve the pull request in github
